# Big Commerce Professional Services Toolkit
### Including Shopify, SquareSpace and Adobe/Magento Coming Soon

Stackware specializes in custom application development across stacks in the enterprise, academic and SMB ecosystems.  Over the last several months, we've been seeing an uptick in demand to support select commercial e-commerce platforms.

In response, we've built out specialists covering these stacks, right alongside our others, to provide continuity and seamless support expected from the full stack experts.

Initially we're working on Big Commerce and Shopify, with SquareSpace and the Adobe/Magento suite up next.

Our key products provide low-cost solutions to common problems:

* Site mobility, cloning, and github orchestration and actions
* App and API setup with fullstack support
* Upgrades, migrations and maintenance

And for custom requirements, our expertise in software solution and build lets us build out what you need and pull in third-party components.

Or adopt the standard, with our white-glove service for the PHP ecosystem, including WordPress, Drupal, Symfony and Laminas.

With core competencies in open source and the web's fundamental technologies, our deep understanding of today's rapidly changing environment, including the leading commercial solutions, is combined with the experience required to deliver end-to-end success.

Check back soon for the release of the site management suite, or ping us today, at contact@stackware.com to get started.
